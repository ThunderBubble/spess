# spess

Unmerged features of this branch:
+ Playable character movement with physics relative to the ship
+ Added power wire prefab
	* Wires can be placed by the player
	* Wires start with an origin object and connect to a module of the appropriate type
	* Wires can be placed at a module
+ Added power module prefab
	* These serve no purpose so far except to end wires
+ Made prefabs for ship block room hitboxes

Outstanding issues:
- Wires started at modules can only be ended by pressing the cancel key
